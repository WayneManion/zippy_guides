## External Guides

The following are links to external guides that I have found useful. These are not my guides, but I have found them useful enough to include here. If you have a guide you would like to see included here, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

### [Klipper Documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/)

The official Klipper documentation. Everything you need to know about Klipper is here. Sometimes it can be a bit hard to find what you are looking for, but it is all here. See the [Other Useful Links](guides/links.md) section for some links to specific pages.

### [Klipper Discord](https://discord.klipper3d.org/)

The official Klipper Discord server. The best place to get one-on-one help with Klipper.

### [Voron Discord](https://discord.com/invite/voron)

The official Voron Discord server. Not just for Voron users!

### [Ellis's Print Tuning Guide](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/)

One of the best guides for tuning your printer. Unlike most guides, this one specifically focuses on Klipper printers. Should be one of your first steps after getting Klipper up and running.

### [Esoterical's CANbus Guide](https://github.com/Esoterical/voron_canbus)

Pretty much the best CANbus installation resource out there. If you are looking to install a CANbus toolboard, this is the guide you want to follow.

### [Other Useful Links](guides/links.md)

A collection of helpful links for Klipper users.
